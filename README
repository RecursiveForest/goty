GoTY (Go Troll Yourself) is a minimal irc client library implemented in Go.

GoTY provides a connection object that gives access to a read and a write 
channel, direct access to the TCP socket, as well as Dial, Connect, and Close 
methods. Everything else is handled outside of the library.

GoTY takes strong influence from Matt Gruen's irc.go: 
http://code.google.com/p/go-bot/source/browse/irc.go

GoTY is bundled with a small example IRC program, sic, which takes influence 
from the suckless.org simple irc client, sic: http://tools.suckless.org/sic
